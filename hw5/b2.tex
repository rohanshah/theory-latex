\section*{Problem B2}
The language $L_1 = \{a^mb^nc^p \mid 1\le m<n<p\}$ is not context-free. Proof by
contradiction, so assume $L_1$ is context-free, then it must also satisfy
Ogden's lemma. Let $m$ be the constant $K > 1$ for Ogden's lemma. Let
$w = a^mb^{m+1}c^{m+2}$ such that $w \in L(G)$. Mark every $a$ in $w$,
no $b$'s or $c$'s are marked. The condition that $w$ contains at least $m$
marked occurences holds since it contains exactly $m$ marked occurences.
By Ogden's lemma there exists some decomposition of $w = uvxyz$ of the
following form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $u=a^i$ such that $i\ge 0$
\item $v=a^i$ such that $i\ge 0$
\item $x=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i\ge 1$ and $j,k\ge 0$
\item $y=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i,j,k\ge 0$
\item $z=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i,j,k\ge 0$
\item $u=a^i,\ v=a^j$ such that $i,j\ge 1$ \textbf{or}
$y=a^i,\ z=a^jb^{m+1}c^{m+2}$ such that $i,j\ge 1$
\item $vxy = a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i<m$ and $j,k\ge 0$
\end{itemize}
There are a finite number of decompositions of $w=uvxyz$ of the above form so we
can continue our proof by case anaylsis on each such decomposition.

The language $L_2 = \{a^nb^nc^p \mid n,p\ge 1, p\neq n\}$ is not context-free.
Proof by contradiction, so assume $L_2$ is context-free, then it must also
satisfy Ogden's lemma. Let $m$ be the constant $K > 1$ for Ogden's lemma.
Let $p=m!$. Let $w = a^{2p}b^{2p}c^p$ such that $w \in L(G)$. Mark every $c$ in
$w$, no $a$'s or $b$'s are marked. The condition that $w$ contains at least $m$
marked occurences holds since it contains $m!$ marked occurences. By Ogden's
lemma there exists some decomposition of $w = uvxyz$ of the following form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $u=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i,j,k\ge 0$
\item $v=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i,j,k\ge 0$
\item $x=a^ib^jc^k$ such that $i,j\ge 0$ and $k\ge 1$
\item $y=c^i$ such that $i\ge 0$
\item $z=c^i$ such that $i\ge 0$
\item $u=a^{2p}b^{2p}c^i,\ v=c^j$ such that $i,j\ge 1$ \textbf{or}
$y=c^i,\ z=c^j$ such that $i,j\ge 1$
\item $vxy = a^ib^jc^k$ such that $k<m$ and $j,k\ge 0$
\end{itemize}
There are a finite number of decompositions of $w=uvxyz$ of the above form so we
can continue our proof by case anaylsis on each such decomposition.
