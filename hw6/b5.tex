\section*{Problem B5}
\subsection*{a}
Prove that telling if a partial recursive function is a constant function is undecidable.  The property that a partially recursive function is a constant function, denotated P, is decidable iff the set $P_C = \{P(a)|a \in C and P(a)\}$ is recursive, where C is the set of partially recursive functions that are constant functions. The set $P_C$ is non-recursive unless C is trivial.  For C to be trivial it must either be the empty set or be the set of all recursive functions. The function $f(x)=0$ is partially recursive and is a constant set, so C is not empty.  The successor function is an example of a partially recursive function that is not constant, so C is not the set of all partially recursive functions.  So we know that C is not trivial, therefore $P_C$ is not recursive and P must be undecidable. 
\subsection*{b} 
Prove that the property of two partial recursive functions being identical is undecidable.
