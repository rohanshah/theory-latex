\section*{Problem B1}
\subsection*{(a)} Show that $\approx$ is a left-invariant equivalence relation
and that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation that is both left and right invariant:
\subsubsection*{$\approx$ is a left-invariant equivalence relation:}
$$x \approx y \implies wx \approx wy ,\ \forall w \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\delta^*(p,x) \in F \iff \delta^*(p,y) \in F,\ \forall p \in Q \implies
\delta^*(p,wx) \in F \iff \delta^*(p,wy) \in F,\ \forall w \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\implies \delta^*(\delta^*(p,w),x) \in F \iff
\delta^*(\delta^*(p,w),y) \in F$$
$$\implies \exists \ p' \in Q \ | \ \delta^*(p,w) = p',
\ \forall p \in Q$$
$$\implies \delta^*(p',x) \in F \iff \delta^*(p',y) \in F$$
\subsubsection*{$\sim$ is an equivalence relation that is both left
and right invariant:}
$$x \sim y \implies uxv \sim uyv,\ \forall u, v \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\delta^*(p,x) = \delta^*(p,y),\ \forall p \in Q \implies
\delta^*(p,uxv) = \delta^*(p,uyv),\ \forall u,v \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\implies \delta^*(\delta^*(p,u), xv) = \delta^*(\delta^*(p,u), yv)$$
$$\implies \exists\ p' \in Q\ |\ \delta^*(p,u) = p'$$
$$\implies \delta^*(p',xv) = \delta^*(p', yv)$$
$$\implies \delta^*(\delta^*(p',x),v) = \delta^*(\delta^*(p',x),v)$$
$$\implies \exists\ p'' \in Q\ |\ \delta^*(p',x) = \delta^*(p',y) = p''
\text{ since } x \sim y \text{ is given.}$$
$$\implies \delta^*(p'',v) = \delta^*(p'',v)$$

\subsection*{(b)}Let $n$ be the number of states in $Q$. Show that $\approx$
has at most $2^{n}$ equivalence classes and that $\sim$ has at most $n^{n}$
equivalence classes.
\subsubsection*{Show that $\approx$ has at most $2^n$ equivalence classes:}
The equivalence relation $\approx$ is defined as
$$x \approx y \iff \forall p \in Q,
\ \delta^*(p,x) \in F \iff \delta^*(p,y) \in F$$
which is equivalent to
$$x \approx y \iff \forall p \in Q,
\ \delta^*(p,x) \notin F \iff \delta^*(p,y) \notin F$$
Therefore, each equivalence class $[x_i]_{\approx}$, where $x_i \in \Sigma^*$,
is defined by a binary relation for each of the $n$ states in $Q$
i.e. either $\delta^*(p, x_i) \in F \text{ or } \delta^*(p,x_i) \notin F$
for each state $p \in Q$. Thus there are $2^n$ possible combinations of
transitions from each of the $n$ states to a state either in or not in $F$
for all strings in $\Sigma^*$ and thus $\approx$ has at most $2^n$ possible
equivalence classes.
\vspace{5 mm}
\newline
For example, let $n = 3$ and $Q = \{p_1, p_2, p_3\}.$ Then all the
$2^n = 2^3 = 8$ possible equivalence classes are defined as follows:
$$[x_1]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_1) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_1) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_1) \in F$$
$$[x_2]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_2) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_2) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_2) \notin F$$
$$[x_3]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_3) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_3) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_3) \in F$$
$$[x_4]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_4) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_4) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_4) \notin F$$
$$[x_5]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_5) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_5) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_5) \in F$$
$$[x_6]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_6) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_6) \in F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_6) \notin F$$
$$[x_7]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_7) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_7) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_7) \in F$$
$$[x_8]_{\approx} : \delta^*(p_1, x_8) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_8) \notin F,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_8) \notin F$$

\subsubsection*{Show that $\sim$ has at most $n^n$ equivalence classes:}
The equivalence relation $\sim$ is defined as
$$x \sim y \iff \forall p \in Q,\ \delta^*(p,x) = \delta^*(p,y)$$
Therefore, each equivalence class $[x_i]_{\sim}$, where $x_i \in \Sigma^*$,
is defined as
$$\exists q \in Q\ |\ \delta^*(p,x_i) = q,\ \forall p \in Q$$
Informally, this states that an equivalence class $[x_i]_{\sim}$ is a
unique combination of mappings from each state in $Q$ to another state in $Q$
(including itself) defined by the transition function $\delta^*$
and the strings $x_i \in [x_i]_{\sim}$. Since there are $n$ possible states to
which a state can transition to, given an input $x_i$, and each relation is
defined for each of the $n$ states in $Q$, there are $n^n$ possible
combinations of state to state transitions. Therefore, there are $n^n$ possible
equivalence classes.
\newpage
\noindent For example, let $n = 3$ and $Q = \{p_1, p_2, p_3\}.$ Then all the
$n^n = 3^3 = 27$ possible equivalence classes are defined as follows:
$$[x_1]_{\sim} : \delta^*(p_1, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_1) = p_1$$
$$[x_2]_{\sim} : \delta^*(p_1, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_1) = p_2$$
$$[x_3]_{\sim} : \delta^*(p_1, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_1) = p_3$$
$$[x_4]_{\sim} : \delta^*(p_1, x_1) = p_1,\ \delta^*(p_2, x_1) = p_2,\ \delta^*(p_3, x_1) = p_1$$

\subsection*{(c)} Prove that $\lambda_L$ is left-invariant, $\mu_L$ is
left and right-invariant, and if $L$ is regular, then both $\lambda_L$ and
$\mu_L$ have a finite number of equivalence classes.

\subsubsection*{Prove that $\lambda_L$ is left-invariant:}
$$u\ \lambda_L\ v \implies wu\ \lambda_L\ wv,\ \forall w \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ zu \in L \iff zv \in L \implies
\forall z,w \in \Sigma^*,\ zwu \in L \iff zwv \in L$$
$$\exists z' \in \Sigma^*\ |\ z'=zw,\ \forall z,w \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ zu \in L \iff zv \in L \implies
z'u \in L \iff z'v \in L,\ z' \in \Sigma^*,\ \forall z,w \in \Sigma^*$$

\subsubsection*{Prove that $\mu_L$ is left and right-invariant:}
$$u\ \mu_L\ v \implies wuw'\ \mu_L\ wvw',\ \forall w,w' \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\forall x,y \in \Sigma^*,\ xuy \in L \iff xvy \in L \implies
\forall x,y,w,w' \in \Sigma^*,\ xwuw'y \in L \iff xwvw'y \in L$$
$$\exists x' \in \Sigma^*\ |\ x'=xw,\ \forall x,w \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\exists y' \in \Sigma^*\ |\ y'=w'y,\ \forall w',y \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\forall x,y \in \Sigma^*,\ xuy \in L \iff xvy \in L \implies
x'uy' \in L \iff x'vy' \in L,\ x',y' \in \Sigma^*,\ \forall x,y,w,w'
\in \Sigma^*$$

\subsubsection*{Prove that if $L$ is regular, then both $\lambda_L$ and $\mu_L$
have a finite number of equivalence classes:}
If $L$ is a regular language then there exists a DFA $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta,
q_0, F)$ where $Q$ contains a finite number of states $n$.
\vspace{5 mm}
\newline
$\lambda_L$ is defined as
$$u\ \lambda_L\ v \iff\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ zu \in L \iff zv \in L$$
which is equivalent to
$$u\ \lambda_L\ v \iff\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ \delta^*(q_0, zu) \in F
\iff \delta^*(q_0, zv) \in F$$
$$\implies \forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ \delta^*(\delta^*(q_0, z),u) \in F
\iff \delta^*(\delta^*(q_0, z),v) \in F$$
$$\implies \forall z \in \Sigma^*,\ \exists\ p \in Q,\ \delta^*(q_0, z) = p$$
$$\implies \delta^*(p,u) \in F \iff \delta^*(p,v) \in F$$
and since $\{p\ |\ \delta^*(q_0, z) = p,\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*\} \subseteq Q$
then the above proposition is true if the following proposition is true
$$\forall p \in Q,\ \delta^*(p,u) \in F \iff \delta^*(p,v) \in F$$
which is equivalent to the above proposition $\approx$ which we proved has at
most $2^n$ equivalence classes. $\lambda_L$ has at most the number of
equivalence classes as $\approx$ since it is only defined for some
$p \in Q$ where as $\approx$ is for all $p \in Q$ and thus has a finite
number of equivalence classes.
\vspace{5 mm}
\newline
Similarly, $\mu_L$ is defined as
$$u \mu_L v \iff \forall x,y \in \Sigma^*,\ xuy \in L \iff xvy \in L$$
which is equivalent to
$$u \mu_L v \iff\ \forall x,y \in \Sigma^*,\ \delta^*(q_0, xuy) \in F \iff
\delta^*(q_0,xvy) \in F$$
$$\implies \delta^*(\delta^*(q_0,x),uy) \in F \iff
\delta^*(\delta^*(q_0, x),vy) \in F$$
$$\implies \exists\ p \in Q\ |\ \delta^*(q_0,x) = p,\ \forall x \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\implies \delta^*(p,uy) \in F \iff \delta^*(p, vy) \in F$$
$$\implies \exists\ q,q' \in Q\ |\ \delta^*(p,u) = q \text{ and }
\delta^*(p,v) = q'$$
$$\implies \delta^*(q,v) \in F \iff \delta^*(q',v) \in F$$
where the above proposition is restricted to the subset
$\{p\ |\ \delta^*(q_0, x) = p,\ \forall x \in \Sigma^*\} \subseteq Q$,
and thus the following proposition encompasses the above proposition
$$\forall p \in Q,\ \delta^*(p, u) = q,\ \delta^*(p,v) = q'
\ |\ \delta^*(q, y) \in F \iff \delta^*(q', y) \in F$$
which is further encompassed when $q = q'$, or $\delta^*(p,u) = \delta^*(p,v)$
yielding the following more general proposition
$$\forall p \in Q,\ \delta^*(p,u) = \delta^*(p,v)$$
which is equivalent to the above equivalence relation $\sim$ which we proved has
at most $n^n$ equivalence classes. $\mu_L$ has at most the number of equivalence
classes as $\sim$ since it is restricted to a subset of $p \in Q$ and
since the transition to $q$ and $q'$ only cover a binary relation whereas
the explicit $q = q'$ covers an $n$ sized relation. Therefore, $\mu_L$ has at
most $n^n$ equivalence classes and thus a finite number of equivalence classes.

h is a morphism:
$h(\delta_1(p,a)) = \delta_2(h(p),a), \forall p \in Q, a \in \Sigma \mid h(q_01) = q_02$ \newline
prove surjective proper homomorphism:
$\mapdef{\pi}{D}{D/\equiv} \implies \pi(p) = [p]$ \newline
$\text{Part 1 }\newline \pi(\delta(p, a) = [\delta(p,a) = \delta/\equiv([p], a)

$\pi(\delta(p, a) = [\delta(p,a) = \delta/\equiv([p], a)

$\text{Part 2 }\newline \pi(q_0) = [q_0]$ this is ok\newline
F-map : ${\pi}(F) \subseteq F$ \newline
B-map: ${\pi}^{-1}(F/\equiv) \subseteq F$ \newline
$\forall [p] \in F/\equiv, {\pi}^{-1}([p]) =\{ q \in Q p = q\}$ \newline
and $p \in F : \{q \in Q \mid p = q\} \subseteq F \text{ iff }
{\pi}^{-1}(F/\equiv) \subseteq F$ using Part 2 \newline
if $p=q \text{ and } p\in F \implies q \in F$ from Part 2 \newline
and its surjective because $\forall \text{ states } q^{'} \in D/\equiv,
\exists q \in Q \text{ such that } {\pi}(p) = p^{'}$ \newline

$p \equiv_D q \text{ iff } \forall w \in \Sigma^{*}
(\delta^{*}(p,w) \in F \text{ iff } \delta^{*}(q,w) \in F)$

To Prove: $ \equiv \subseteq \equiv_D$
$\equiv \subseteq \equiv_D \cup_{i \ge 0} \equiv_{Di}$
Claim: $\equiv \subseteq \equiv_i $ for all $i \ge 0$
Proof by induction. \newline
Base Case: $i = 0$.   Show $\equiv \subseteq \equiv_0 $ \newline
0 equivalence ($\equiv_0 $) means either $p,q \in F$ or $p,q \in$ F compliment. 
\newline $p \equiv_{0} q \text{ iff } p,q \in F \text{ or } p,q \notin F $.  
\newline
Assume $p \equiv q$. If $p \in F$, by (2), then $q \in F \implies p \equiv_0 q$. If $p \not \in F$, then by contrapositive $q \not\in F \implies p \equiv_0 q$. 
\newline
Inductive Step:\newline Inductive hypothesis: if $p \equiv q$ then $p \equiv_i q$\newline
By (1), $\delta (p,a) \equiv \delta (q,a)$. By the inductive hypothesis, $\delta (p,a) \equiv_i \delta (q,a)$, for all a $ \in \Sigma$. But, $p \equiv_i q$ and 
$\delta(p,a) \equiv_i \delta(q,a)$, which means $p \equiv_{i+1} q$.

\subsection*{(c)}
PART 1\newline
We have DFAs $D_1$ (trim) and $D_2$. There exists a morphism from $D_1$ to $D_2$
iff $\simeq_{D1} \subseteq \simeq_{D2}$. Suppose there exists a morphism $h:D_1 \rightarrow D_2$. Assume $\simeq_{D1} \subseteq \simeq_{D2}$. Because $D_1$ is
trim, if the morphism exists, then for every $p \in Q \text{ and } u
 \in \Sigma^{*} \text{ such that } p = \delta_1^{*}(q_{0,1}, u),$ $ 
h(p) = \delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u)$.\newline
So, define (for any chosen u) $h(p) = \delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u)$ such
 that $p = \delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, u)$.
But, we need to prove for any other $v$ such that $\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, v) = p 
\text{ then } \delta^{*}_2 (q_{0,2} = \delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u) = h(p)$.
We already have $\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1} , v) = \delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, u) = p
\implies u \simeq_{D_1} v \text{ (by definition) and we also have } 
\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2} \implies  u \simeq_{D_2} v$.
Therefore $\delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2} , u) = \delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, v)$ because $D_1$ is trim. \newline
Check that h is a morphism by showing $h(q_{0,1})=q_{0,2}$. By definition,
$q_{0,1}=\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1} , \epsilon )$ and 
$q_{0,2}=\delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2} , \epsilon )$.
Pick a string that takes you to $p=\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, u)$. \newline
$\delta_1(p,a) = \delta_1(\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1} , u), a) =
\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, ua)$. \newline
$h(q)=h(\delta_1(p,a))=\delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, ua) )=
\delta_2(\delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u), u)
= \delta_2(h(p),a)$. 

\medskip

PART 2\newline
Case: $\implies$ \newline
If there is a F-map $h: D_1 \rightarrow D_2$, we know from part (1) that 
for any morphism between DFAs, $\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$.  
We also know from Homework 1 that if there is an F-map, then $L(D_1) \subseteq L(D_2)$. \newline
Case: $\Longleftarrow$ \newline
We have $\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$ and $L(D_1) \subseteq 
L(D_2)$ . We know from part 1 that $\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$
 means there is a unique morphism, and if we pick any $p \in F_1$ then
we want to show $h(p) \in F_2$. 
So, $\delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, u) = p \in F_1 \text{ and with } L(D_1) \subseteq 
L(D_2) \text{ it must be that } \delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u) = p \in F_2 
\text{ so the morphism is an F-map. }$

\medskip

PART 3\newline
If there is a B-map $h: D_1 -> D_2$ we know from part 1 that for any morphism between DFAs $h: D_1 -> D_2 \mid \simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$.  We also know from hwk1 that $L(D_2) \subseteq L(D_1)$ if there is a B-map.\newline
If $\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$ and $L(D_2) \subseteq L(D_1)$ . We know from part 1 that $\simeq_{D_1} \subseteq \simeq_{D_2}$ means there is a morphism, and if we pick any $p \in F_2$ then $\delta^{*}_2(q_{0,2}, u) = p \in F_2 \text{ and with } L(D_2) \subseteq L(D_21) \text{ it must be that } \delta^{*}_1(q_{0,1}, u) = p \in F_1 \text{ so the morphism is a B-map. }$\newline

\subsection*{(d)}
Prove that $D_m$ is miminmal for L iff there is a unique proper homomorphism
$h:D \rightarrow D_m$ where D is a trim DFA accepting L.\newline
		First, assume that D' is a trim DFA such that $L(D') = L$ and
		that for every trim DFA D that accepts L there is an $h: D \rightarrow D'$ (UPH).
		Given any minimum DFA $D_m$ accepting L, then by our hypothesis there
		exists $f:D_m \rightarrow D'$ (UPH), then D' has at most as many states 
                as $D_m$ so D' is also minimal.
	We proved that for any trim DFA D there is a unique SPH from D to any
	minimal DFA $D_m$ accepting L. \newline
Converse: If D' is a DFA accepting L, and  if there is a UPH $h: D \rightarrow D'$ from any trim
DFA accepting L, then D' must be minimal.
	From our hypotheses we have $f: D_m \rightarrow D'$ and $h: D' \rightarrow D_m$
	From part (c) and from our hypothesis above, $f:D_m \rightarrow D'$.
	Since we have these two PH then the number of states must be equal because
	of the congruence of the two classes.

\section*{Problem B3}
\subsection*{(a)}
Suppose we have a regular language $L$ and that $\exists
D = \{Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\}$ such that $L(D) = L$.
We will show by a proof by construction that
$L^{(1/3)} = \{ w \mid www \in L\}$ is regular;
\newline First we will create 3 DFAs:
$$D^1_{pq} = \{Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, \{p\}\} \text{ and }
L(D^1_{pq}) = \{u \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^* (q_0,u) = p\}$$
$$D^2_{pq} = \{Q, \Sigma, \delta, p, \{q\}\} \text{ and }
L(D^2_{pq}) = \{u \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^* (p,u) = q\}$$
$$D^3_{pq} = \{Q, \Sigma, \delta, q, F\} \text{ and }
L(D^3_{pq}) = \{u \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^* (q,u) \in F\}$$
No we can say that
$L^{(1/3)} \subseteq L(D^1_{pq}) \cap L(D^2_{pq}) \cap L(D^3_{pq})$ and that
$L^{(1/3)} = \bigcup_{p,q \in Q}
L(D^1_{pq}) \cap L(D^2_{pq}) \cap L(D^3_{pq})$.
Since regular languages are closed under union and intersection
$L^{(1/3)}$ is regular since it is made from 3 languages that are regular,
they have a DFA. \newline
Proof that the $L^{(1/3)} = \{ w \mid www \in L\}$:\newline
By executing  $D^1_{pq} , D^2_{pq} , D^3_{pq}$ on $w \in L^{(1/3)}$
we would have followed a path such that:
$$\delta^*(\delta^*(\delta^*, w), w), w) \in F \implies$$
$$www \in L \text{ therfore }w \in L^{(1/3)}$$
\newline $L^{(3)}$ is not regular. say $L = \{a^nb \mid n \ge 1\}$
now need to get an approrpriate suffix to break this thing from Myhil-Nerode.
\subsection*{(b)}
Suppose we have a regular language $L$ and that $\exists    D = \{Q, \Sigma,
\delta, q_0, F\}$ such that $L(D) = L$.
We will show by a proof by construction that all languages of the form
$L^{(1/k)} = \{ w \mid w^k \in L\}$ are regular;
\newline First we will create $k$ regular languages:
$$L^i_{p_i...p_{k-1}} = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^*(p_{i-1},w) = p_i\},
\forall i \mid 2 \le i \le k-1 $$
$$L^1_{p_i...p_{k-1}} = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^*(q_0,w) = p_1\}$$
$$L^k_{p_i...p_{k-1}} = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \delta^*(p_{k-1},w) \in F\}$$
From this we can see that
$L = \bigcup_{p_i...p_{k-1} \in Q} \bigcap^k_{i=1} L^i_{p_i...p_k}$.
We must now prove that they are equal:
\newline
By executing a string $w$ on the DFAs we have created we would have followed
a path such that:
$\sigma^*(q_0,w) = p_1 , \sigma^*(p_1, w) = p_2 ... \sigma^*{p_{k-1}, w} \in F$.
Therefore we would have a path from $q_0$ to $q_F \in F$ that is for the word
$w^k$. So all workable strings on the right are in the left.
\newline
For all of the strings in in the left to the right,
we will choose a p to get started so it works.
\subsection*{(c)}
Is $L^{1/\infty}$ regular? $L^{1/\infty} = \bigcap_{k\ge1}L^{1/k}$.
From above we know all those languages are regular, and $k$ is finite so
yes $L^{1/\infty}$ is regular.
\newline
Is $\sqrt{L}$ regular? $\sqrt{L} = \bigcup_{k-1}L^{1/k}$.
From above we know all those languages are regular,
and k is finite so yes $\sqrt{L}$ is regular
\newline
Is $L^{\infty}$ regular? Since $L^{\infty}$ is an infininite series it can not be turned into a regular language.
\section*{Problem B4}
\subsection*{(a) $L_1 = \{wcw\ |\ w \in \{a,b\}^*\}$
\textnormal {is} not \textnormal{regular.}}
Proof by contradiction using Myhill-Nerode. $L_1$ is infinite since
each $x \in L_1$ is comprised of $w \in \{a,b\}^*$ which is an infinite
language. Proof by contradiction so assume $L_1$ is regular. Therefore, by
Myhill-Nerode there exists an equivalence relation $\simeq$ that is
right-invariant and contains a finite number of equivalence classes. Since
$\{a,b\}^*$ is infinte and $\{a,b\}^* \subseteq \Sigma^*$ there exist
$w,w' \in \{a,b\}^*$ and thus $w,w'\in \Sigma^*$ such that
$w \neq w'$ and $w \simeq w'$. Let $z \in \Sigma^*$ be the string $cw$.
Since $\simeq$ is right-invariant, $wz \simeq w'z$ which is
equal to $wcw \simeq w'cw$. But since $w \neq w'$, $wcw \in L_1$
and $w'cw \notin L_1$ which is a contradiction to the fact that they are
$\simeq$ equivalent strings thus $L_1$ is not regular.

\subsection*{(b) $L_2 = \{xy\ |\ x,y \in \{a,b\}^*
\textnormal{ and } |x| = |y|\}$ is \textnormal{regular.}}
Proof using Myhill-Nerode. Let $\simeq$ be an equivalence relation on
$\Sigma^*$ consisting of two equivalence classes $[x_{even}]$ and $[x_{odd}]$.
The index of $\simeq$ is finite since it consists of exactly 2
equivalence classes. We define $\simeq$ as $\forall x,y \in \Sigma^*,
x \simeq y \iff |x|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|\ \mod\ 2$, i.e. $\forall x \in \Sigma^*$,
$x \in [x_{even}]$ iff $|x|\ \mod\ 2 = 0$ and $x \in [x_{odd}]$ iff
$|x|\ \mod\ 2 = 1$. Now we can prove that $\simeq$ is right-invariant:
$$ x \simeq y \implies xz \simeq yz,\ \forall x,y,x \in \Sigma^*$$
$$ |x|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|\ \mod\ 2 \implies |xz|\ \mod\ 2 = |yz|\ \mod\ 2$$
$$ |x|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|\ \mod\ 2 \implies |x|+|z|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|+|z|\ \mod\ 2$$
$$ |x|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|\ \mod\ 2 \implies |x|\ \mod\ 2 = |y|\ \mod\ 2 \wedge
|z|\ \mod\ 2 = |z|\ \mod\ 2$$
Finally we show that $L_2$ is the union of some equivalence classes of $\simeq$.
$L_2$ is equal to the equivalence class $[x_{even}]$ with the corrollary that
$\{a,b\}^* = \Sigma^*$ when $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$ as is the case in this problem:
$$ z \in L_2 \iff \exists x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } |x| = |y|
\text{ and } z = xy$$
$$\implies |z| = |xy| = |x| + |y| = |x| + |x| = 2|x|$$
$$\implies |z|\ \mod\ 2 = 2|x|\ \mod\ 2 = 0$$
$$\therefore z \in L_2 \iff z \in [x_{even}]$$
Thus by Myhill-Nerode $L_2$ is regular, since it is the union of some of the
equivalence classes of an equivalence relation $\simeq$ on $\Sigma^*$, which
is right-invariant and has a finite index.

\subsection*{(c) $L_3 = \{a^n\ |\ n \textnormal{ is a prime number}\}$
\textnormal{is} not \textnormal{regular}}
Proof by contradiction using Myhill-Nerode. $L_3$ is infinte since there are
an infinte number of prime numbers $n$. Proof by contradiction so assume $L_3$
is regular. Therefore, by Myhill-Nerode, there exists an equivalence relation
$\simeq$ that is right-invariant and with a finite number of equivalence
classes. Consider the infinite set $\{a^2, a^3, a^5, a^7, ...\} \subseteq
\Sigma^*$ i.e. the infinite subset of strings in $\Sigma^*$ with prime length.
Since it is an infinte subset of $\Sigma^*$ and there are a finite number of
equivalence classes over $\simeq$, there exists $a^i$ and $a^j$ such that $i$
and $j$ are prime, $i < j$, and $a^i \simeq a^j$. Since $i < j$ there exists
some $r > 0$ such that $i + r  = j$. Therefore $a^i \simeq a^{i+r}$.
By the right-invariance of
$\simeq$, $a^i \simeq a^{i+r} \implies a^{i}z \simeq a^{i+r}z,
\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*$. Let $z = a^r \in \Sigma^*$ then
$a^{i}a^{r} \simeq a^{i+r}a^{r}$ which is equivalent to
$a^{i+r} \simeq a^{i+2r}$. Therefore, $a^i \simeq a^{i+r} \simeq a^{i+2r}$.
By induction it follows that, $a^i \simeq a^{i + kr},\ \forall k \ge 0$.
Let $k = i$, then $a^i \simeq a^{i+ir} = a^{i(1+r)}$. Therefore,
$a^i \simeq a^{ix}$ and since $i < ix$, $x \ge 2$, thus $ix$ is not prime. So
$a^i \simeq a^{ix}$ but $a^i \in L_3$ and $a^{ix} \notin L_3$ which is a
contradiction to their $\simeq$ equivalence therefore $L_3$ is not regular.

\subsection*{(d) $L_4 = \{a^{m}n^{n}\ |\ gcd(m,n) = 17\}$
\textnormal{is} not \textnormal{regular}}
Proof by contradiction using Myhill-Nerode. $L_4$ is infinte since there are
an infinte number of multiplies of 17 by prime numbers so maintaints the
greatest common denomiator as 17. Proof by contradiction so assume $L_4$ is
regular. Therefore, by Myhill-Nerode, there exists an equivalence relation
$\simeq$ that is right-invariant and with a finite number of equivalence
classes. Consider the infinte set $\{a^{17i}\}$ where $i$ is a
prime number. Since it is an infinite subset of $\Sigma^*$ and there are a
finite number of equivalence classes, there exists $p$ and $q$ such that
$p < q$, $p$ and $q$ are both prime, and $a^{17p} \simeq a^{17q}$. By the
right-invariance of $\simeq$, $a^{17p} \simeq a^{17q} \implies
a^{17p}z \simeq a^{17q}z,\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*$.
Let $z = b^{17q} \in \Sigma^*$ then $a^{17p}b^{17q} \simeq a^{17q}b^{17q}$.
By the fact that $p$ and $q$ are both prime, $gcd(17p, 17q) = 17$ so
$a^{17p}b^{17q} \in L_4$ but $gcd(17q, 17q) = 17q$ so
$a^{17q}b^{17q} \notin L_4$ which is a contradiction to the fact that the two
are $\simeq$ equivalent. Therefore, $L_4$ is not a regular language.

\section*{Problem B5}
\subsection*{(a)}
Let $L = L_1 \cap L_2$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular languages. Since
$L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular, there exist equivalence relations $\simeq_{L_1}$
and $\simeq_{L_2}$ that are right-invariant, have a finite index, and have
contain a subset of equivalence classes who's union define the languages
$L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. Let $\simeq_L$ be an equivalence relation, over
$\Sigma^*$, for the language L. Let the equivalence classes of $\simeq_L$
be defined as the union of the equivalence classes of $\simeq_{L_1}$ and
$\simeq_{L_2}$. It is immediate then, that $\simeq_L$ has a finite index since
the union of two finite sets is finite. We now create the language L from the
union of some of the equivalence classes of $\simeq_L$ while simultaneously
reducing the number of equivalence classes in $\simeq_L$ to make sure it is
well-defined. We start by combining equivalence classes in $\simeq_L$ in the
following way. If there $\exists x \in \Sigma^*$ such that
$x \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_1}}$ (some equivalence class of $\simeq_{L_1}$) and
$x \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_2}}$ (some equivalence class of $\simeq_{L_2}$)
then combine the two equivalence classes by taking their union. This is safe to
do since $x \simeq_{L_1} y,\ \forall y \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_1}}$ and
$x \simeq_{L_2} y',\ \forall y' \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_2}}$ therefore it must be true
that $y \simeq_{L_2} y',\ \forall y \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_1}},
y' \in [x]_{\simeq_{L_2}}$. Now we can define the language L as the union of all
such combined equivalence classes where the two equivalence classes
$[x]_{\simeq_{L_1}}$ and $[x]_{\simeq_{L_2}}$ that were combined where each in
their respective subset of equivalence classes that define their languages
$L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. In other words, $\forall x \in \Sigma^*
\text{ if } x \in L_1 \text{ and } x \in L_2$ then $x$ is in some equivalence
class of $\simeq_{L_1}$ and $\simeq_{L_2}$ which we combine into one equivalence
class in $\simeq_L$. The union of all of these such classes then defines
$L_1 \cap L_2 = L$ where $\simeq_L$ is still finite since we have only reduced
the number of equivalence classes from a starting finite amount. Now we can
finally show that $\simeq_L$ is right-invariant since it directly follows from
the fact $\simeq_{L_1} \text{ and } \simeq_(L_2)$ are right-invariant:
$$(1)\ x \simeq_L y \implies x \simeq_{L_1} y \text{ and/or } x \simeq_{L_2} y$$
$$(2)\ x \simeq_{L_1} y \implies xz \simeq_{L_1} yz,\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*$$
$$(3)\ x \simeq_{L_2} y \implies xz \simeq_{L_2} yz,\ \forall z \in \Sigma^*$$
$$\text{therefore } x \simeq_L y \implies xz \simeq_L yz \text{ by a combination
of the above three implications}$$
Thus $L_1 \cap L_2$ is the union of some of the equivalence classes of an
equivalence relation $\simeq_L$ on $\Sigma^*$, which is right-invariant and has
a finite index and therefore by Myhill-Nerode $L = L_1 \cap L_2$
is a regular language.
\subsection*{(b)}
Let $L = h^{-1}(L') = \{u \in \Sigma^*\ |\ h(u) \in L'\}$. Let $\simeq_L$ be an
equivalence relation on $\Sigma^*$ for the language L where
$\forall u,v \in \Sigma^*,\ u \simeq_L v \iff h(u) = h(v)$. Since $L'$ is a
regular language there exists an equivalence relation $\simeq_{L'} $
on $\Delta^*$ that has a finite index, is right-invariant, and where
$L'$ is equal to the union of some of the equivalence classes of $\simeq_{L'}$.
Therefore, $\simeq_L$ is finite since $\forall u \in \Sigma^*$ there are only
finitely many equivalence classes $h(u)$ can belong to thus there only
finitely many equivalence classes $u$ can belong to. Let $u \in L \iff h(u) \in
L'$ by the definition of $L$. Since $h(u) \in L'$ is equivalent to a subset of
the equivalence classes of $\simeq_{L'}$, $u \in L$ is also a subset of
equivalence classes of $\simeq_L$, specifically those where $h(u) \in L'$.
Finally, we can prove that $\simeq_L$ is right=invariant:
$$u \simeq_L v \implies uz \simeq_L vz,\ \forall u,v,z \in \Sigma^*$$
$$h(u) = h(v) \implies h(uz) = h(vz)$$
$$\implies h(u)h(z) = h(v)h(z)$$
$$\implies h(u)h(z) = h(u)h(z)$$

Thus, since $\simeq_L$ is an equivalence relation on $\Sigma^*$ that has a finite
index, is right-invariant, and where the union of some of the equivalence classes
of $\simeq_L$ is equal to $L$, by Myhill-Nerode, $L = h^{-1}(L')$ is a regular
language. Now we can prove by contradiction that the number of states of any
minimal DFA for $L = h^{-1}(L')$ is at most the number of states of any minimal
DFA for $L'$. Proof by contradiction so suppose not. Then there exists
$n$ states in $D_L$ and $m$ states in $D_{L'}$ such that $n > m$. Therefore,
there must exist $u,v \in \Sigma^*$ such that $h(u) = h(v)$ and $u \nsim_L v$
otherwise it would have to be the case that $n \le m$. Thus, $\forall w \in
\Sigma^*,\ h(uw) = h(vw)$ therefore $uw \in F \iff vw \in F$ so the equivalence
classes are indistinguisable and since $D_L$ is a minimal DFA unique states
associated with the equivalent classes are state equivalent therefore $D_L$ is
not a minimal DFA. The number of states for $D_L$ also cannot be strictly
smaller because then there would exist the case that $u \simeq_L v$ but
$h(u) \neq h(v)$ which means there exists some $w \in \Sigma^*$ such that
$h(uw) \in L'$ and $h(vw) \notin L'$ which implies $uw \in L$ and $vw \notin L$
which is a contradiction which is a contradiction to the right-invariance that
$u \simeq_L v \implies uw \simeq_L vw $.

\section*{Problem B6}

\subsection*{(i)}
Prove that $R_{i_{0}+1} = R_{i_{0}}$ for some least $i_0$.\newline
Must show: $R_{i_{0} + 1} = (R_{i_{0}} \cup 
\{(\delta(p, a), \delta(q, a)) \mid (p, q)\in R_{i_{0}},\ a\in \Sigma\})_{\approx} 
= R_{i_{0}}$ for some least $i_0$.\newline
Because $R \subseteq QxQ$ is finite, there must be some $i_0$ such that 
$R_{i_0+1} = R_{i_0}$.

\medskip

Prove that $R_{i_{0}}$ is the smallest forward closure
containing $R$.

\medskip

If $\delta(p, q) \in R_{i_{0}}$, then $(\delta(p, a), \delta(q, a)) \in 
R_{i_{0}+1}$ for all $a \in \Sigma$. But since $R_{i_{0}+1}=R_{i_{0}}$, then 
$(\delta(p, a), \delta(q, a))$ will also be in $R_{i_{0}}$, which shows that
$R_{i_{0}}$ is a forward closure by definition.

\medskip

Let $\sim$ be any forward closure. Because $R_{i_{0}}$ must be the smallest, 
show $R_{i_{0}} \subseteq \sim$. \newline
Prove by induction for all $i \ge 0$ in $R_i \subseteq \sim$. \newline
Base Case ($i=0$): $R_i = R_{approx}$ /newline
Inductive Case: Assume $R_i \subseteq \sim$ as the inductive hypothesis.
$\delta(p, q) \in R_i \implies (p,q) \in \sim$ and since $\sim$ is a forward
closure, $(\delta(p, a),\delta(q, a)) \in \sim$ for every a. 
$(R_{i} \cup 
\{(\delta(p, a), \delta(q, a)) \mid (p, q)\in R_{i},\ a\in \Sigma\}) \subseteq
\sim$, and since $(R_{i} \cup                    
\{(\delta(p, a), \delta(q, a)) \mid (p, q)\in R_{i},\ a\in \Sigma\})_{\approx}$
is the least forward closure by definition, it follows that $R_{i_{0}} \subseteq \sim$.

\subsection*{(ii)}
Prove that $p\equiv q$ iff the forward closure $R^{\dagger}$ of the
relation $R = \{(p, q)\}$ is good.

\medskip

First Case: Assume $R^{\dagger}$ is good. Prove that $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv$.
If we can show this, it is immediate that $p \equiv q$. Prove by induction for 
all $i \ge 0$ in $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv_i$. 
\newline
The base case with $i=0$ is trivial.
\newline
Inductive Case: Assume $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv_i$ as the inductive hypothesis. \newline
If $(r,s) \in R^{\dagger}$ then $(\delta(r, a), \delta(s, a)) \in R^{\dagger}$.
By the inductive hypothesis $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv_i \implies r \equiv_i
s$. \newline
$r \equiv_{i+1} s$ iff $r \equiv_{i} s$ and $\delta(r, a) \equiv_{i} \delta(s, a)$. We have shown that both $r \equiv_{i} s$ and 
$\delta(r, a) \equiv_{i} \delta(s, a)$ hold. So, for any two states $(r,s) \in
R^{\dagger}$, $r \equiv_{i+1} s$ and $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv_{i+1}$, 
so $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv$.

\medskip

Second Case: Assume $p \equiv q$. Prove $R^{\dagger}$ is good. \newline
Claim: If $p \equiv q$, then $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv$.  \newline
Proof: $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation containing $R=\{(p,q)\}$, since 
$p \equiv q$ and $\equiv$ is forward closed. Since $R^{\dagger}$ is the smallest
forward closure containing R and since $\equiv$ is forward closed and contains R, $R^{\dagger} \subseteq \equiv$. \newline
So every pair $(p,q) \in \equiv$ is good which means every $(p,q) \in R^{\dagger}$ is good. Therefore, $R^{\dagger}$ is good.
